                <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the Department of Computer</h3>
                <p>The department of computer science is one of the departments in the Faculty of Science, Adeyemi Federal 
                    University of Education (AFUED). The department is known for its edge-cutting research and highly referenced
                    researchers who have made impact to the field of computing, home and abroad.
                </p>
                
                <h5 style="color: rgb(32, 32, 212); font-weight: 400; margin-top: 2.5rem;">History and Philosophy of the Department</h5>
                <p>
                    The Department of Computer Science, AFUED was established in 1992, when AFUED was still known as Adeyemi College of
                    Education for the purpose of producing NCE graduates in Computer Science Education. In that year, it was then 
                    combined with the Department of Mathematics which had been in existence since the inception of the College. The Department
                    was then known as Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. Students were admitted through the Pre-NCE programme
                    into NCE 1. This mode of admission was later adjusted in 2007, in line with the directive of the National Commission 
                    for Colleges of Education (NCCE) that NCE 1 students should be admitted through the Matriculation Examination for 
                    Polytechnics and Colleges conducted by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During 1994/1995 session, Computer Science became a full fledged department. Presently the Department runs programme
                    for the award of 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE)</li>
                        <li>Diploma in Computer Studies</li>
                        <li>NCE (part time) Sandwich programme</li>
                    </ol>
                    Over the years, the Department has developed with modern computer equipment and standard laboratory to make it competitive
                    and comparatively excelling other departments among recognized tertiary institution of learning offering Computer
                    Science programme in Nigeria.
